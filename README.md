# Online Store - Python Project

## Introduction

This Python project implements the main logic for an online store. It allows customers to search for items, add items to their shopping cart, remove items from their cart, and ultimately make a purchase. The project consists of three main classes: `Item`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Store`.

## Classes
### Item Class
Items are the building blocks of the store. Each item has the following attributes:

### ShoppingCart Class
The ShoppingCart class represents a customer's shopping cart. It includes methods to add items, remove items, and calculate the subtotal.

### Store Class
The Store class is responsible for managing the store's inventory. It loads items from a file and provides methods for searching items by name or hashtag, adding/removing items from the cart, and checking out.
